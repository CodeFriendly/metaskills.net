h1. Todo

* Design
  - Fixed Left Nav / Fat Bottom Area
* Test &, <, > in content with Tidy.
* Turn on "Cross-domain Receiver URL" in DISQUS settings.
* Make sure to use "--style compressed" with sass.
* Think about google sitemap again.
* Consider using feedburner vs my own alternate atom?
  - Consider this XML too. https://github.com/metajack/metajack.im/blob/master/atom.xml


h1. Development Setup

Misc notes on setting up a development environment. Rarely needs to be done, but wanted to document my personal setup.

  $ sudo port install py26-pygments
  $ bundle install

Remember to add /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin to my $PATH so that pygmentize can be found. After all things are installed, here are some development helpers. The first is handy to watch SASS changes while writing CSS, the second will create the site and tidy it.

  $ sass --scss --watch _sass:_site/resource --style compact --no-cache
  
  $ setopt rmstarsilent
  $ rm -rf _site/* && sass _sass/site.scss:resource/site.css && jekyll && 
    find _site -name "*.html" -exec tidy -config $(pwd)/tidy.conf {} \;
