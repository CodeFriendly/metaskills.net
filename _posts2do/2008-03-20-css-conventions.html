<p>Within a paragraph &lt;p&gt; tag you can use &lt;code&gt; tags to denote a command. When you do this, the text within the code tags will show up highlighted in a monospace font. For example... you must type in <code>sudo port install ruby</code> when installing ruby via MacPorts.</p>

<p>If you use the CSS class <code>.external-link</code> on an &lt;a&gt; tag, then that link will do two things. First it will show a small icon to the right that denotes the link will be opened in a new window. Second, when the page loads the MetaContent javascript class will add a <code>target="blank"</code> to the link so that it opens in a new window. The reason for this is that target attribute is not XHTML compliant.</p>

<p>If you use &lt;pre&gt; tags outside of a paragraph then the it will appear in a code sample box like the first example below showing some shell environment variables. However if you give the tag a command class like &lt;pre class=&quot;command&quot;&gt; then the enclosing text will be presented in a similar box that shows that this command is a shell command by displaying a corresponding graphic.</p>

<pre>
  # My PATH Environment Variables
  export PATH="/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"
  export MANPATH="/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH"
  export INFOPATH="/opt/local/share/info:$INFOPATH"
</pre>

<pre class="command">sudo port install ruby</pre>


<p>The Meta theme incorporates CSS for Mephisto's implementation of the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/coderay/" class="external-link">CodeRay</a> library. To have mephisto use CodeRay to syntax highlight your code, wrap the code with &lt;macro:code lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;code&lt;/macro:code&gt;. The code will look like the example below.</p>

<macro:code lang="ruby">
  # Ruby 1.9 introduces BasicObject.
  # Use Builder's BlankSlate until then.
  unless defined? BasicObject
    require 'blankslate'
    BasicObject = BlankSlate
  end
</macro:code>

<p>If you want to use a &lt;blockquote&gt; tag, please put a &lt;div&gt; immediately inside of it to get the best formatting.</p>

<blockquote><div>I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.</div></blockquote>
