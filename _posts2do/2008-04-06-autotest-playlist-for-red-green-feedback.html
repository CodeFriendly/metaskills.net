<p>Here is how to get a playlist of sounds that will be hooked to both your autotest :red and :green callbacks. Basically this gives you a folder of sounds that are played one after another, in a loop, as your tests pass or fail. See this move below for a quick example.</p>

<div class="iecenter mt10"><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HV_drKDclFA"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HV_drKDclFA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object></div>

<h2>Step 1: Install QTPlay from MacPorts</h2>

<pre class="command">
sudo port install qtplay
</pre>

<h2>Step 2: Download My Autotest Playlist Files</h2>

<pre class="command">
cd ~
curl -O http://www.metaskills.net/files/autotest_playlist.tar
tar -xf autotest_playlist.tar
mv autotest_playlist .autotest_playlist && rm autotest_playlist.tar
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Modify Your .autotest File</h2>

<p>User your favorite editor to open your <code>~/.autotest</code> file. And add this code below to it. Now you should be setup to have your own playlist of sounds that play using the <code>qtplay</code> binary installed above. If you want to play around with the sounds, then <code>open ~/.autotest_playlist/sounds</code> and start swapping out sounds. By the way, I made the :initialize and :quit sounds using the new Alex voice in Leopard. I hijacked some text to speech and then ran an audio tool called WavePad to speed change, flange, and chorus the voice a little bit.</p>

<macro:code lang="ruby">
require '~/.autotest_playlist/playlist'
</macro:code>
