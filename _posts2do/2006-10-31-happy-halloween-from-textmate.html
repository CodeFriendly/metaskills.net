<p>Upon downloaded the Cutting-Edge version (1.5.4 r1311) of TextMate yesterday, I was happy to find a halloween surprise. How cool can one program be - thanks Allan! Especially to some of your latest work on <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/10/28/new-dialog-system-for-commands/" rel="external-link" class="external-link">extending the dialog</a> features for bundle developers.</p>
