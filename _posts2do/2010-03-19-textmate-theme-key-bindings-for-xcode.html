  I've been using Xcode for about 8 hard core months now and for all this time I have been using a theme I made that mimics the All Hallow's Eve TextMate theme with a bunch of custom key bindings that make Xcode more TextMate compatible. Here are links to download both below and a few notes I have put together. As I remember more of what I have actually done, this post will get updated. I do remember the first thing I did with Xcode for almost 3 days was just to customize the heck out of it and these files are the results.

      <img src="/assets/2010/3/19/fonts_and_colors2.gif" alt="Xcode Fonts & Colors" width="86" height="50" /><br />
      TextMate All Hallows Eve Theme
    </a>

      TextMate Key Bindings
    </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  To use these download and unzip them. Please the theme in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color Themes</code> and place the bindings in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Key Bindings</code>. That should be it. Hare are my notes for now on what the key bindings do.

</ul>
