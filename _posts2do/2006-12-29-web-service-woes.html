<p>Only now do I really get this image from <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000585.html" rel="external-link">DHH's blog</a>. I am really beginning to despise SOAP for some reason, but I guess I will "get it" as I learn more about it -- as it seems to be the only way to do business with the big players out there. For a glimpse of some of my hell, check out this <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/02/ruby-soap4r-wsdl-hell/" rel="external-link">Ruby + SOAP4R + WSDL Hell</a> article.</p>

<p>The bad news aside, I was really happy to find someuseful tools today from Todd Ditchendorf <a href="">Scandalous Software</a> site. The list is pretty extensive so go check it out. Not on the list that I was happy to see were:</p>

<p>Check XML and XHTML documents for Well-Formedness and Validity while editing them in TextMate with support for DTD, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron and XInclude.</p>

<img src="/files/soaphell/texmlmate.gif" alt="TextMate XML Editor" />
</a>
</div>

<p>SOAP Client is a free Cocoa-based developer tool for Mac OS X Tiger that allows you access and debug WSDL & SOAP-based Web Services from the comfort of your desktop.</p>
