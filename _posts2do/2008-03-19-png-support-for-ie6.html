<p>Obviously the Meta theme uses a lot of PNG images for styling its structural presentation. Many of these had to be striped for IE 6 since that browser can not use PNG files natively in content nor CSS elements such as background declarations. Fortunately however, the Meta theme does incorporate a <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola" title="PNG Support for IE by Bob Osola" class="external-link" rel="external">JavaScript routine</a> that enables PNG support for Internet Explorer in all the content areas. Meanwhile IE 7 does support PNG images. In this case it will ignore the IE 6 JavaScript fix.</p>

	<div style="margin: 10px auto; width:504px; text-align:center">
		<div style="margin: 0 5px;">
			<img src="/files/metatheme/meta_drax.png" width="261" height="399" alt="PNG Support Example Image - Drax The Destroyer" />
		</div>
	</div>

<p>If you are using Internet Explorer 6, the image's shadow below it should feather out smoothly to the paper background of the page. Normally IE 6 and lower will show a PNG with a light blue background. If you are using Firefox, Safari and the like, great, PNGs are supported natively.</p>
